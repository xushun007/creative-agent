Goal: {goal}

Create a numbered list of concrete steps that describe what needs to be accomplished. Each step should be a high-level task description, not specific tool calls.

Available capabilities include:
- Web content fetching and analysis
- File reading and writing operations  
- Content analysis and summarization
- Text processing and generation

Focus on the logical sequence of tasks needed to accomplish the goal. Use natural language to describe what should be done in each step.

Example format:
1. Gather information about the topic from web sources
2. Analyze the collected information for key points
3. Create a structured summary document
4. Save the results for user review

Return only the numbered list of steps, nothing else."""
